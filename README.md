# Listly
Listly is a todo app, featuring CRUD ( **Create Read Update Delete** ) operations using SwiftData, the sole purpose of creating this project was to understand and explore the SwiftData. 

You'll be able to learn how to perform basic CRUD operations and make data persistent through this project. I've used UIKit programmatic code in the entire project. I've tried to explain the whole process of creating this app in my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18037868773496808/) highlights. Trust me you'll love it.
